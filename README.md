# Park-Restroom-Planning-
This project solves a problem of optimal restroom placement in a park using search algorithms, developed as part of a programming assignment in the NCCU's Introduction to AI course. It demonstrates the implementation of heuristic search techniques like hill-climbing and random-restart hill climbing.
